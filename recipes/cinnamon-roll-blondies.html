        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These cinnamon roll blondies are everything you love about cinnamon rolls, just in an easy-to-make, chewy, cookie bar form.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Blondies</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Glaze</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ounce full fat cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>7 tablespoons confectioner's sugar, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons heavy cream, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.</li>
            <li>For filling: in a small bowl, mix brown sugar and cinnamon together until thoroughly combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>For blondies: Whisk melted butter, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, salt, and nutmeg until thoroughly combined. Add in egg and egg yolk and mix until thoroughly combined. Add in flour and baking soda and mix until just incorporated.</li>
            <li>Spread half the batter into an even layer in the prepared pan (it will be a somewhat thin layer). Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the batter. Place dollops of remaining batter over the cinnamon-sugar layer, and carefully spread into an even layer to cover cinnamon-sugar completely.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bars begin to pull away from the sides of the pan, are puffed in the middle, and golden brown on top, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow bars to cool completely in the pan.</li>
            <li>For glaze: beat cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla and salt together with an electric mixer until completely smooth. Add in heavy cream and beat until smooth. If glaze is too thick, add more heavy cream a small amount at a time; if glaze is too thin, add more powdered sugar until desired consistency is reached.</li>
            <li>Pour glaze onto cooled bars and spread into an even layer. Cut into 16 bars.</li>
        </ol>
