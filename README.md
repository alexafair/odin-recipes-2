This project should help me learn how to use my new HTML skills!

After completing the project, I have learned that it is very important to look for typos and to make sure all your syntax is correct. I couldn't figure out why one of my index links was working and on closer inspections, I had typed "a hrers" instead of "a hrefs" so I will be more careful in the future.
